# I want to work on the tests; what do I do?

To use the tests, you will need to install Node -- you can do this via the
[download page](http://nodejs.org/#download)

Note that on Windows, there are some reports that you will need to restart
after installing Node.

You can clone or download this repo. Once you have done so, from the root
directory of the repo, run:

    npm install
    npm run start

You can then view the tests in your browser at
[http://localhost:4444](http://localhost:4444).

When you visit that page, all of the tests should be failing; your job is to
get the tests to pass. To do this, you'll need to refer to the tests in the
files in the `tests/app` directory, and edit the files in the `app/` directory.
Once you update a test, you can reload the test page in the browser to see
whether it worked.

# I want to complete the project; what do I do?

1. Create a React App with the following two inputs. Using a boilerplate like create-react-app is fine.
    1. A multiline text input that will accept a list of names, one per line.
    2. A dropdown that allows the user to select one of several languages.
2. Generate name tags for each name in the text input with a greeting in the language corresponding to the language chosen in the dropdown.
3. Make the source available as a cloneable repo, for example, on Github, and provide the link below. Be sure to include instructions on how to run the application in the README.
